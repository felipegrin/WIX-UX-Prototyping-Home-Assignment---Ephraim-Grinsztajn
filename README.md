# WIX UX Prototyping Home Assignment - Ephraim Grinsztajn

### Overview
This project is a code-based prototype illustrating a new approach for the Editor’s ‘Add panel’. 

It demonstrates:
- Opening and closing the panel
- Navigation between different categories & sub-categories in the panel
- Adding an element to stage (how is it done, what happens once it’s done)
- Elements arrangement in the panel

There are visual clues for clickable elements to indicate functional components in the demo.

### About the Project Code Structure
- The Add Panel HTML code is  inside the "Add Panel" section inside the index.html
- The Add Panel CSS code is inside assets/css/add-panel.css
- The Add Panel Javascript code is inside assets/js/add-panel.js
- The project uses jQuery for simplicity of the interactions code

### Observations
- Only one category of the panel was illustrated (Buttons)
- All the components to be added to the stage in the list are images for simplicity of the demo, even though is clear that in the real application the components to be added would be coded components
- The Search Input is not functional. Further development of the task would require thoughts about how the results are displayed.
- Responsiveness was not taken into account
