### Overview
This project is a code-based prototype illustrating a new approach for the Editor’s ‘Add panel’. 

It demonstrates:
- Opening and closing the panel
- Navigation between different categories & sub-categories in the panel
- Adding an element to stage
- Elements arrangement in the panel
- Resize of the panel
- Filter/Search Element

There is an introduction modal with instructions for the tester. Anytime during the test the user can press SHIFT to see visual clues on the screen.

### About the Project Code Structure
- The Add-Panel HTML code is  inside the "Add Panel" section inside the index.html
- The Add-Panel CSS code is inside assets/css/add-panel.css
- The introduction modal CSS code is inside assets/css/instructions.css
- The Add-Panel Javascript code is inside assets/js/add-panel.js
- The Drag & Drop Javascript code is inside assets/js/drag-and-drop.js
- The Filter Javascript code is inside assets/js/filter.js
- The project uses jQuery for simplicity of the code

### Observations
- Only one category of the panel was illustrated (Buttons)
- All the components to be added to the stage are images for simplicity of the demo, even though is clear that in the real application the components to be added would be coded components
- A shadow appears on the buttons hover. In the real application the actual hover state of each button should happen on hover.
- Responsiveness was not taken into account
